# C Practice Summary

## Practice blocks

- [`01-c-basics`](practice/01-c-basics/) — basic C syntax, input, conditions, strings
- [`02-loops-functions-shapes`](practice/02-loops-functions-shapes/) — loops, functions, nested loops, Mario-style shapes

## Date

2026-05-29

## Programs written

- `hello.c` — prints hello world
- `compare.c` — compares two integers
- `password.c` — simple password check using `strcmp`

### compare

A simple program that asks for two integers and compares them.

Practiced:

- `int` variables
- `scanf("%i", &x)`
- `if / else if / else`
- `<`, `>`, `==`
- `return 0`

### password

A simple password check program.

Practiced:

- `char password[100]`
- `scanf("%99s", password)`
- `#include <string.h>`
- `strcmp(password, attempt) == 0`
- basic string comparison

## Important notes

- Standard C does not have CS50's `string` type.
- `char` arrays can be used for simple strings.
- `strcmp(...) == 0` means strings are equal.
- `scanf("%99s", ...)` reads one word only.
- This password program is only for learning, not real security.

## Next topic

Loops:

- `for`
- `while`
- repeated attempts
- simple repeated input

## 2026-05-30 — Loops, validation, and functions

### Programs written

#### `counter.c`

A simple program that prints numbers from 1 to 10.

Practiced:

* `for` loops;
* loop counter variable;
* `i++`;
* loop start and stop conditions.

#### `meow.c`

A program that asks the user how many times to print `Meow!`.

Practiced:

* reading integer input with `scanf("%i", &n)`;
* printing repeated output with a `for` loop;
* validating positive input with a `do while` loop.

#### `password_attempts.c`

An improved password-checking program with up to 3 attempts.

Practiced:

* `char` arrays for simple strings;
* `scanf("%99s", ...)`;
* string comparison with `strcmp`;
* fixed number of attempts using a `for` loop;
* using `break` to exit the loop early;
* using a flag variable such as `int success = 0`;
* checking login failure after the loop.

#### `meow_function.c`

A version of the meow program using a custom function.

Practiced:

* defining a custom function with `void meow(void)`;
* calling a custom function with `meow();`;
* understanding `void` as “returns nothing” and “takes no arguments”;
* moving repeated behavior out of `main`.

### New concepts practiced

* `for` loops
* `do while` loops
* repeated input validation
* `break`
* flag variables
* custom functions
* `void` functions
* function calls
* common C syntax mistakes and fixes

### Important notes

* A `for` loop is useful when the number of repetitions is known.
* A `do while` loop is useful when input must be requested at least once.
* `break` can stop a loop early after a successful condition.
* A flag variable can store whether something happened during a loop.
* Custom functions make `main` cleaner and reduce repeated code.
* `scanf("%i", &n)` needs `&n` because `scanf` writes input into the variable.
* `scanf("%99s", array)` is safer than `%s` because it limits input size.
* `%s` is used for strings, while `%c` reads raw characters.

### Current practice status

I can now write, compile, and test small standard C programs using:

* variables;
* `printf`;
* `scanf`;
* `if / else`;
* `for`;
* `do while`;
* `break`;
* flag variables;
* `char` arrays;
* `strcmp`;
* custom functions.

### Next practice goals

* nested loops;
* vertical and horizontal rows of `#`;
* simple square grid;
* function prototypes;
* CS50-style Mario exercises.

## 2026-06-01 — 2026-06-02 — Shapes, nested loops, and functions

### Programs written

* `column.c` — prints a vertical column of `#`
* `row.c` — prints a horizontal row of `#`
* `square.c` — prints a square using nested loops
* `square_function.c` — prints a square using a helper function
* `rectangle.c` — prints a rectangle using separate height and width
* `rectangle_function.c` — prints a rectangle using a helper function
* `mario_stairs.c` — prints left or right Mario-style stairs
* `better_mario_stairs.c` — improved stairs program with helper functions and direction validation
* `mario_pyramid.c` — prints a CS50-style double pyramid with height validation from `1` to `8`

### New concepts practiced

* nested loops;
* shape drawing in terminal;
* helper functions with parameters;
* local variables and function scope;
* `scanf(" %c", &dir)` for character input;
* logical OR `||`;
* logical AND `&&`;
* character input validation;
* separating program logic into smaller functions.

### Important notes

* In shape programs, the outer loop usually controls rows.
* The inner loop usually controls columns.
* A left staircase can be built with `row + 1` hashes.
* A right staircase needs spaces before hashes.
* For a right staircase:

```text
spaces = height - row - 1
hashes = row + 1
```

* A function does not automatically access variables from `main`.
* Values should be passed to functions as parameters.
* `dir == 'l' || 'L'` is incorrect because `'L'` alone is always true.
* The correct form is `dir == 'l' || dir == 'L'`.

### Final exercise: `mario_pyramid.c`

I completed a CS50-style Mario double pyramid program in standard C.

The program combines the main ideas from this practice block:

* positive integer input;
* range validation from `1` to `8`;
* nested loops;
* spaces and hashes;
* fixed gap between pyramid halves;
* formatted terminal output.

Example:

```text
Enter height: 3
  #  #
 ##  ##
###  ###
```

This exercise became the final task for the current loops, nested loops, functions, and simple shapes practice block.

### Current practice status

I can now write and test small C programs using:

* `for` loops;
* `do while` loops;
* nested loops;
* integer input;
* character input;
* helper functions;
* function parameters;
* simple validation;
* terminal-based shapes.

### Next practice goals

- refactor `mario_pyramid.c` using helper functions;
- improve input safety by checking the return value of `scanf`;
- learn function prototypes;
- continue with arrays and strings.
